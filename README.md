# MY SPRING BOOT PROJECT
A RESTful API built with Spring Boot for managing products with basic authentication.

## üöÄ Features
- User authentication with JWT
- CRUD operations for products
- Exception handling and logging
- H2 in-memory database (for dev)

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Maven
- H2
- JUnit & Mockito

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven 3.x

### Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vgeadau/store.git
cd store
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### THE TASK (AS RECEIVED)
- (1) Create a GitHub profile if you don't have one
- (2) Use git in a verbose manner, push even if you wrote only one class
- (3) Create a Java, maven based project, SpringBoot for the web part
- (4) No front-end, you can focus on backend structure
- (5) Implement some functions, for example: add-product, find-product, change-price or others
- (6) Implement a basic authentication mechanism and role based endpoint access
- (7) Design error mechanism and handling plus logging
- (8) Write unit tests, at least for one class
- (9) Use Java 17+ features
- (10) Add a small Readme to document the project
- (11) Other information

### CHOICES REGARDING TASK (SOME IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS)
- (1) - Project location: https://github.com/vgeadau/store (branch main)
- (2) - There is a lot of verbose not only in GIT but more so on written classes.
- (3) - Store - It is a Java 17 (Corretto) Project that uses Maven.
- (4) - No frontend layer provided for this APP.
- (5) - Implemented 2 controllers
- (5.1) - StoreController - responsible with CRUD operations on Product. We have here methods such as:
- (5.1.1) getAllProducts - returns all products containing a title if provided, otherwise all products
- (5.1.2) getProductById - finds a Product by an ID
- (5.1.3) createProduct - creates a Product from the ProductDTO received body
- (5.1.4) updateProduct - updates a Product from the ProductDTO received body
- (5.1.5) deleteProduct - deletes a Product.
Products are associated to user, so one user cannot delete other user's products.
- (6) - AuthController - responsible with basic authentication API(s). I am using in this POC (proof of concept),
JWT to generate a token. 
In SecurityConfig - I configured which API(s) requires basic authentication and which don't. 
There is room for improvement here, as we are using only 2 roles and this application is viewed mostly as
a Store platform - Product Management Module, we didn't needed multiple authenticated roles
So for this POC we have:
- (6.1) "unauthenticated" people that have the right to read (GET operations from (5.1))
- (6.2) "authenticated" people that are actually STORE ADMINS that applies CRUD operation on PRODUCTS

However, in a more complex application we can also consider CUSTOMERS. 
That are allowed to ORDER, BUY, SET PAYMENT METHODS, SET DELIVERY OPTIONS ETC. 
This user role wasn't taken into consideration.
- (7) - GlobalExceptionHandler - responsible with error handling and logging
A project specific exception was also defined - StoreException - BAD_REQUEST 400
Unexpected exceptions return with HttpStatus: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR 500
Multiple other custom Exceptions could have been used, however as this is a POC we use StoreException everywhere.
Logs were added in GlobalExceptionHandler to avoid duplication.
- (8) - This project has a high coverage as can be noticed (45 tests). Some methods are fully covered.
- (9) - New features isn't necessary better features for example "record" breaks naming standard.
Instead of getUsername or getPassword we have methods named: username(), password() breaking the standard naming conventions.
Lambda and Stream collections also are problematic causing performance issues, multiplying by a factor of N the memory
requirements, as well, as being very hard to debug.
Anonymous classes for example was also a new feature that proved to be a total bomb in the code causing memory leaks.

- (11) Other info:
- (11.1) I added dependency in the REST endpoints to support both XML and JSON outputs - WebConfig
- (11.2) Controllers were implemented to be light:
They should not contain code such try / catch, or conversions from entity to dto(s).
- (11.3) UserDTO doesn't contain password. This DTO is used in Product. Password was purposely skipped,
because we don't allow user to change his password while performing product operations.
- (11.4) Several motives why I choose my StoreException to implement RuntimeException:
 - Clean code / vs verbose
 - Better suited for business logic errors
 - Should bubble up to the controller layer
 - Are handled globally (e.g. via @ControllerAdvice)
 - Don‚Äôt represent programming mistakes or recoverable conditions
 - Easier integration with Spring‚Äôs exception handling
 - Avoids swallowing or over-handling errors
 - Checked exceptions often lead to catch blocks where developers may:
 - Swallow exceptions silently (catch (Exception e) {} )
 - Wrap them repeatedly in new exceptions just to compile
 - Unchecked exceptions encourage you to only catch what you intend to handle.
- (11.5) username and pseudonym have unique non-null constraints.
- (11.6) a ManyToOne relation was defined for author (product's owner)
- (11.7) H2 in memory database was chosen for this project alongside JPA.
- (11.8) Bonus implementation - Added some basic functionality for banned user. "Diego" is a banned user.
These users cannot be modified at this point in this POC, but the application can be extended to support
further functionality.
- (11.9) In order to respect D from SOLID for AuthService(authenticate method), I added a service that
provides instances of classes - ClassService - using reflection.
- (11.10) In order to respect S from SOLID methods have a single point of exist (1 return statement). It is
easier to debug (only one breakpoint instead of multiple breakpoints for each return statement).

### POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS, NOTES, AND OTHER INFO (WHICH WERE NOT DONE DUE TO TIME LIMITATIONS)
- (1) Extra documentation OPENAPI (Swagger) can be implemented attached to the project
- (2) Adding Jacoco for project coverage
- (3) Magic vales (numbers and text) were not externalized in all the unit tests (due time limitations), but
the source code should not have such magic values.
- (4) Use ObjectMapper instead of manual mapping, but I've chosen to avoid adding more dependencies.
- (5) Instead of having multiple API(s) for getting a product, we could use something like GraphQL which allows
writing one API while allowing user to filter the products by any combination of fields.
- (6) BigDecimal should be used for Finance related calculus in java however I choose double for this POC
- (7) Lombok / Builder pattern could have been used to obtain / create objects with more parameters.
